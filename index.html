    <h1>Manifesto for Agile Business</h1>
    <p>We have found that the Agile Manifesto applies to more than just software development. Through this work we have rewritten the Agile Manifest to better suit the business as a whole.</p>

    <p class="values"><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</p>
    <p class="values"><strong>Delivering business outcomes</strong> over comprehenisive documentation</p>
    <p class="values"><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</p>
    <p class="values"><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</p>

    <p>While the right hand side is important, we value the items on left more.</p>

    <p><i>We follow these principles..</i></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
            through early and continuous delivery
            of valuable business outcomes.</li>
        <li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
            delivery. Agile processes harness change for 
            the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
        <li>Deliver buesiness outcomes frequently, from a 
            couple of days to a couple of weeks, with a 
            preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
        <li>Business and technical people must work 
            together daily.</li>
        <li>Build products and teams around motivated individuals. 
            Give them the environment and support they need, 
            and trust them to get the job done.</li>
        <li>The most efficient and effective method of 
            conveying information to and within a delivery 
            team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
        <li>Business outcomes and customer satisfaction are
            the primary measures of progress.</li>
        <li>Agile processes promote sustainable delivery. 
            The sponsors, delivery team, and users should be able 
            to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
        <li>Continuous attention to technical excellence 
            and good design enhances agility.</li>
        <li>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
            of work not done--is essential.</li>
        <li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
            emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
        <li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
            to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
            its behavior accordingly.</li>
    </ol>
